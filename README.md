# NYC Transportation Demand Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict transportation demands in New York City based on geographic zones. The transportation includes **taxis**, **for-hire vehicles** (FHV) (i.e., Uber, Lyft, etc.), **buses** and **subways**. 

By analysing factors such as **weather conditions**, **traffic incidents**, and **events**, the model aims to provide accurate forecasts to improve transportation efficiency.

To achieve this, the project aims to integrate data from OpenWeather, NYC TLC, NYC OpenData, New York State Data, and Eventbrite.
